# salesforce-90-days-challenge
Tracking my hands-on Salesforce development journey: Apex, LWC, Flows, Integrations, and projects.
### Day 1
- Created a Salesforce Lightning App: My Recruitment App
- Added custom objects: Company & Job Application
- Added tabs and sample data
- Repo created to document daily progress

### Day 2
- Added custom fields on Company object (Industry, Company Size, Website, Headquarters)
- Added custom fields on Job Application object (Position Title, Status, Expected Salary, Notes, Interview Date)
- Created lookup relationship (Job Application → Company)
- Designed clean page layouts with proper sections
- Updated page layouts for both objects
- Added sample records and tested relationships

### Day 3 – Data Validation + Controls
- Added validation rules on Job Application:
  - Interview date cannot be in the past
  - Expected salary must be greater than zero
  - Position required when Status = Interviewing
- Marked important business fields as Required
- Created multiple List Views for Job Applications (Applied, Interviewing, Offered, Rejected)
- Filtered records to validate data quality

## Day 4 – Job Application Workflow & User Experience Enhancements

On Day 4, I focused on improving the Job Application workflow by enhancing usability, enforcing data quality, and guiding users through a structured hiring process.

### 1. Page Layout Optimization
- Cleaned and reorganized page layouts for both Company and Job Application objects.
- Grouped fields into meaningful sections such as:
  - Job Details
  - Compensation
  - Interview
  - Notes
- Removed unnecessary system fields from the main view to improve readability and user focus.

### 2. Validation Rules for Data Integrity
Implemented validation rules to ensure correct data entry:
- Prevented status progression to "Interviewing" unless Interview Date is filled.
- Made Company selection mandatory to avoid orphan Job Applications.
These rules simulate real-world business constraints commonly used in recruitment systems.

### 3. Salesforce Path Implementation
- Configured Salesforce Path on the Job Application object using the Status picklist.
- Defined stages: Applied → Interviewing → Offered → Rejected.
- Added Guidance for Success at each stage to assist users in understanding next actions.

### 4. Celebration & User Feedback
- Enabled Celebration for the final stage (Offered) to enhance user experience.
- This provides visual feedback and improves adoption for business users.

### 5. Kanban View for Recruiter Workflow
- Used Kanban view to visualize Job Applications by Status.
- Enabled drag-and-drop status updates, simulating how recruiters track candidates in real time.

### Outcome
This setup demonstrates how Salesforce can be used not just as a data storage system, but as a guided, process-driven application that improves efficiency, data quality, and user experience.


## Day 5 – Automating Recruitment Workflow with Salesforce Flow

### What I built
Created a Record-Triggered Flow on the Job Application object to automate status updates and reduce manual recruiter work.

### Automation Logic
- Flow Type: Record-Triggered Flow (After Save)
- Trigger: Job Application record is created or updated
- Entry Conditions:
  - Interview Date is NOT null
  - Status is NOT equal to "Interviewing"
  - Flow runs only when record is updated to meet conditions

### Automated Action
- Automatically updates Status to "Interviewing" when an Interview Date is added

### Why this matters
This automation ensures data consistency and prevents recruiters from forgetting to update application status manually. It reflects real-world recruitment workflows where process enforcement is critical.

### Outcome
- Eliminated manual status updates
- Improved data accuracy
- Created a scalable, production-ready automation using Salesforce Flow

### Skills Used
- Salesforce Flow Builder  
- Record-Triggered Automation  
- Business Process Automation  
- Data Quality Enforcement

## Day 6 – Salesforce Flow Automation (Recruitment Workflow)

Implemented a production-style record-triggered Flow to automate Job Application status transitions based on real recruitment events.

### What was done
- Built a Record-Triggered Flow on the Job Application object
- Configured selective entry conditions so the flow runs only when:
  - Interview Date is added, or
  - Offer Date is added
- Used Decision elements to control valid status transitions:
  - Applied → Interviewing (when Interview Date is populated)
  - Interviewing → Offered (when Offer Date is populated)
- Ensured the flow exits safely when conditions are not met
- Prevented unnecessary executions and infinite loops by validating current status

### Why this matters
This automation removes manual dependency on recruiters to update application status, improves data accuracy, and reflects a real-world recruitment lifecycle instead of demo-level automation.

### Key learning
Effective Salesforce automation should be event-driven, selective, and controlled. Status changes should be driven by meaningful business actions, not by every record edit.


## Day 7 – Email Automation with Salesforce Flow

### What I Built
Implemented email automation for a recruitment workflow using Salesforce Flow.

### Key Work
- Created **Classic Email Templates** for:
  - Interview Scheduled
  - Offer Released
- Configured **Email Alerts** on the Job Application object
- Built a **Record-Triggered Flow** to:
  - Auto-update application status (Applied → Interviewing → Offered)
  - Trigger email alerts when Interview Date or Offer Date is added
- Passed **Triggering Record ID** correctly to Email Alerts

### Outcome
- Recruiters receive instant notifications
- Status updates are fully automated
- No manual follow-ups required

### Learnings
- Email Alerts require Classic Email Templates
- Correct merge field syntax `{! }` is critical
- Flows should trigger only on meaningful business events


# Day 8 – Advanced Salesforce Flow: Status Automation with Email Alerts

## Overview
Built an advanced Record-Triggered Flow on the Job Application object to automate recruitment stages and notifications in Salesforce.

## What This Flow Does
- Automatically updates Job Application status based on business logic
- Sends Interview Scheduled email when Interview Date is added
- Sends Offer Released email when Offer Date is added
- Prevents duplicate emails using boolean flags
- Ensures emails are sent only once per stage

## Flow Logic
1. Trigger: Job Application record is created or updated
2. Decision Element:
   - If Status = Applied AND Interview Email not sent
     → Update Status to Interviewing
     → Send Interview Scheduled Email
     → Mark Interview Email as Sent
   - If Status = Interviewing AND Offer Email not sent
     → Update Status to Offered
     → Send Offer Released Email
     → Mark Offer Email as Sent
3. Default path ends flow safely

## Key Salesforce Features Used
- Record-Triggered Flow
- Decision Elements
- Update Records
- Email Alerts
- Boolean Flags to prevent re-triggering

## Day 17 – SOQL Fundamentals & Using SOQL in Apex

### What I Learned Today
- Learned how Salesforce retrieves data using SOQL
- Practiced writing efficient SOQL queries using SELECT, WHERE, and LIMIT
- Understood why querying only required fields is critical for performance
- Executed SOQL queries inside Apex using Execute Anonymous
- Stored query results in Apex Lists and reviewed output using debug logs
- Learned the most important best practice: **Never use SOQL inside loops**

### Why This Is Important
SOQL inside Apex is the foundation for:
- Triggers
- Apex classes
- LWC backend controllers

Poorly written SOQL can easily hit governor limits and break applications, so understanding efficient querying is critical before moving deeper into Apex.

### Sample Apex Code
```apex
List<Job_Application__c> apps =
    [SELECT Id, Name, Status__c
     FROM Job_Application__c
     WHERE Status__c = 'Interviewing'
     LIMIT 5];

System.debug(apps);
```
---

---

### What I Learned Today

- Understood Salesforce data relationships (Lookup-based)
- Practiced **Child-to-Parent** SOQL queries using relationship fields (`__r`)
- Practiced **Parent-to-Child** SOQL queries using subqueries
- Learned how to identify the correct **Child Relationship Name**
- Executed relationship queries inside Apex using Execute Anonymous

---

### Child to Parent Query (Job Application → Company)

```Apex
List<Job_Application__c> applications =
    [SELECT Id, Name, Status__c, Company__r.Name
     FROM Job_Application__c
     LIMIT 5];

System.debug(applications);
```
### Parent to Child Query (Company → Job Application)
```Apex
List<Company__c> companies =
    [SELECT Id, Name,
        (SELECT Id, Name, Status__c FROM Job_Applications__r)
     FROM Company__c
     LIMIT 3];

System.debug(companies);
```
---

## Day 19 Aggregate SOQL (COUNT, GROUP BY)

- Executed aggregate queries inside Apex using AggregateResult
- Learned how to read aggregate values using alias names
- Understood why Aggregate SOQL is preferred over looping in Apex for performance

---

### Sample Aggregate Query (Count per Status)
```apex
List<AggregateResult> results =
    [SELECT Status__c status, COUNT(Id) total
     FROM Job_Application__c
     GROUP BY Status__c];

for (AggregateResult ar : results) {
    System.debug('Status: ' + ar.get('status'));
    System.debug('Total: ' + ar.get('total'));
}
```
---
## Day 20 – Advanced SOQL (WHERE, ORDER BY, HAVING, LIMIT)

### Objective

- Controlled data volume using `LIMIT`
- Filtered aggregated results using `HAVING`
- Understood the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`
- Executed advanced SOQL queries inside Apex using `AggregateResult`
- Learned why OFFSET should be avoided for large datasets

---

### Sample SOQL with HAVING and ORDER BY
```apex
List<AggregateResult> results =
    [SELECT Status__c status, COUNT(Id) total
     FROM Job_Application__c
     GROUP BY Status__c
     HAVING COUNT(Id) > 1
     ORDER BY COUNT(Id) DESC];

for (AggregateResult ar : results) {
    System.debug(ar.get('status') + ' → ' + ar.get('total'));
}
```
